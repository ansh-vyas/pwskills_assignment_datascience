    "1. Manual Copy-Pasting: The simplest form of web scraping involves manually copying and pasting data from web pages into a spreadsheet or text document. This method is suitable for scraping small amounts of data or when the structure of the data is straightforward.\n",
    "2. Regular Expressions (Regex): Regular expressions are patterns used to identify and extract specific data from text. Web scraping with regular expressions involves writing patterns that match the desired data and using them to search and extract information from the HTML source code of web pages. This method requires knowledge of regular expression syntax and is typically used for scraping data with consistent patterns.\n",
    "3. HTML Parsing: HTML parsing is a technique that involves parsing the HTML structure of a web page to extract desired data. This can be done using libraries such as BeautifulSoup in Python or other programming languages. HTML parsing provides more flexibility in navigating and extracting data from the page, as it allows for searching elements by their tags, classes, or other attributes.\n",
    "4. Web Scraping Frameworks and Libraries: There are several frameworks and libraries specifically designed for web scraping, such as Scrapy in Python. These frameworks provide a more structured and efficient way to scrape data from multiple pages or entire websites. They often include features like handling cookies, session management, and concurrent requests to optimize the scraping process.\n",
    "5. Headless Browsers: Headless browsers, such as Puppeteer or Selenium, simulate a web browser without a graphical user interface. They allow you to automate interactions with web pages, including filling forms, clicking buttons, and scrolling. Headless browsers can be useful when scraping data from websites that heavily rely on JavaScript for rendering content.\n",
    "6. API Access: Some websites offer Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that allow developers to access and retrieve data in a structured manner. APIs provide a more reliable and authorized way to obtain data, as they are specifically designed for programmatic access. Instead of scraping web pages directly, you can make requests to the API endpoints and receive data in a predefined format like JSON or XML."
