    "The threading module in Python is used for creating and managing threads in a multithreaded program.

    "a.) **activeCount() Function**:\n",
    "   - **Use**: The activeCount() function is used to get the current number of active threads (Thread objects) in the current Python interpreter.\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: It helps you monitor and check how many threads are currently running or in a runnable state.\n",
    "\n",
    "b.) **currentThread() Function**:\n",
    "   - **Use**: The currentThread() function is used to obtain a reference to the currently executing Thread object.\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: It allows you to access information about the current thread, such as its name or other thread-specific data.\n",
    "\n",
    "c.) **enumerate() Function**:\n",
    "   - **Use**: The enumerate() function is used to obtain a list of all currently alive Thread objects.\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: It helps you inspect and interact with all active threads in your program.\n",

    "The functions run(), start(), join(), and isAlive() are related to working with threads in a multithreaded programming environment, often associated with languages like Python that provide support for multithreading. These functions are commonly used when working with threads to control their execution and query their states.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **run()**:\n",
    "   - The run() method is not typically directly invoked by the programmer when working with threads. Instead, it is a method that can be overridden in a custom class that extends the Thread class (or implements the Runnable interface in Java). The custom class represents the thread's behavior.\n",
    "   - When the thread is started using the start() method (explained below), the run() method of the custom class is automatically executed in the new thread. It contains the code that defines the task or behavior of the thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **start()**:\n",
    "   - The start() method is used to begin the execution of a thread.\n",
    "   - It allocates system resources for the new thread.\n",
    "   - It invokes the run() method of the thread's target, effectively starting the execution of the thread.\n",
    "   - It allows the thread to run concurrently with other threads.\n",
    "   - It's important to note that you should call start() on a thread object, not directly on the Thread class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **join()**:\n",
    "   - The join() method is used to wait for a thread to complete its execution. When you call join() on a thread, the program will block (pause) until the thread being joined finishes its task.\n",
    "   - This method is often used to ensure that the main program doesn't proceed further until the thread has completed its work. It's useful for synchronizing the execution of threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **isAlive()**:\n",
    "   - The isAlive() method is used to check whether a thread is currently running or has completed its execution. It returns True if the thread is alive (running) and False if it has terminated.\n",
    "   - This method can be helpful for monitoring the state of threads and making decisions based on their status.\n",

    "#### Deadlock:\n",
    "Deadlock is a situation where two or more threads are blocked indefinitely, each waiting for a resource that is held by another thread within the same set. In other words, it is a state where two or more threads are unable to proceed because each is waiting for a resource that can only be released by another waiting thread. \n",
    "Deadlocks can occur when the following four conditions hold simultaneously:\n",
    "- Mutual Exclusion: At least one resource must be held in a non-sharable mode.\n",
    "- Hold and Wait: A process must be holding at least one resource and waiting for another resource.\n",
    "- No Preemption: Resources cannot be forcefully taken away from a thread; they must be released voluntarily.\n",
    "- Circular Wait: A circular chain of two or more threads, where each thread is waiting for a resource held by the next thread in the chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deadlocks can be quite challenging to debug and resolve since they require careful analysis and coordination of resource allocation to avoid the circular wait condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Race Condition:\n",
    "A race condition occurs when two or more threads access shared data or resources simultaneously, resulting in unpredictable behavior or incorrect results. It happens when the correctness of the computation depends on the relative timing or interleaving of events between threads. Race conditions can occur due to the lack of proper synchronization mechanisms and can lead to data inconsistency, integrity issues, or program crashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider two threads that are concurrently incrementing a shared counter variable. If the threads do not synchronize their access to the counter using locks or other synchronization primitives, a race condition can occur. The order in which the threads execute their increments and the interleaving of their operations can lead to incorrect results, such as lost updates or overwriting each other's changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent race conditions, proper synchronization techniques like locks, mutexes, or atomic operations should be used to ensure exclusive access to shared resources and maintain data consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both deadlocks and race conditions are common concurrency issues that can occur in multithreaded or parallel programs. Understanding and addressing these issues is crucial for developing robust and correct concurrent software."
