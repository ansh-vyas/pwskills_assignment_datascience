    "The main difference between the Euclidean distance metric and the Manhattan distance metric in K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is how they measure the distance between data points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Euclidean Distance**:\n",
    "   - Measures the straight-line (Euclidean) distance between two points in a Euclidean space.\n",
    "   - Formula: d = √[(x2-x1)^2 - (y2-y1)^2]\n",
    "   - Considers both the magnitude and direction of differences between features.\n",
    "   - Creates spherical decision boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Manhattan Distance**:\n",
    "   - Measures the sum of absolute differences (city block or Manhattan distance) between two points' coordinates.\n",
    "   - Formula: d = [mod(x2-x1) + mod(y2-y1)]\n",
    "   - Considers only the magnitude of differences between features, ignoring their direction.\n",
    "   - Creates square or grid-like decision boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Affect of Performance on KNN :**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sensitivity to Scale**:\n",
    "  - Euclidean distance is sensitive to differences in scale between features. Features with larger scales can dominate the distance calculation.\n",
    "  - Manhattan distance is less sensitive to scale differences, making it suitable for datasets with features of varying scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Directional Sensitivity**:\n",
    "  - Euclidean distance considers both the direction and magnitude of feature differences. It's suitable when features have isotropic relationships (equal influence in all directions).\n",
    "  - Manhattan distance only considers horizontal and vertical movements and is suitable for cases where features have anisotropic relationships (unequal influence in different directions).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Impact on Decision Boundaries**:\n",
    "  - The choice of distance metric can affect the shape and orientation of decision boundaries in KNN.\n",
    "  - Euclidean distance tends to create circular or spherical decision boundaries.\n",
    "  - Manhattan distance tends to create square or grid-like decision boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sparse Data**:\n",
    "  - In cases where data is sparse (many zero feature values, e.g., text data), Manhattan distance can be more effective as it measures the effort to traverse a grid-like structure."

Larger K values (e.g., 10, 20, or more) smooth the decision boundary, making the model less sensitive to noise, but they can underfit if the data has complex patterns, capturing more global trends.\n",

    "   - **Cross-Validation**: Experiment with both distance metrics and use cross-validation to determine which one performs better for a specific dataset and problem.\n",
    "   - **Hybrid Approaches**: In some cases, hybrid distance metrics that combine aspects of both Euclidean and Manhattan distances (e.g., Minkowski distance) can be used to provide a balance between sensitivity to scale and direction.\n",

    "1. **Number of Neighbors (K)**: [n_neighbors : int, default=5]\n",
    "   - **Effect**: Determines the number of nearest neighbors considered when making predictions. Smaller values of K may lead to more flexible models, while larger values may result in smoother decision boundaries.\n",

    "   - **Advantages**: Larger training sets tend to provide better generalization, especially for complex datasets. They are less likely to overfit and can capture more diverse patterns in the data.\n",

    "Drawbacks of using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) as a classifier or regressor:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Computationally Intensive**: KNN can be slow, especially on large datasets, as it requires computing distances for each data point. To overcome this, you can use approximate nearest neighbor search algorithms or dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sensitivity to Noise and Outliers**: KNN is sensitive to noisy data and outliers because it considers all neighbors equally. Robustness can be improved by using distance-weighted voting or outlier detection techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Curse of Dimensionality**: In high-dimensional spaces, distance-based metrics become less meaningful, and KNN may struggle to find meaningful neighbors. Dimensionality reduction methods like PCA or feature selection can help mitigate this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Imbalanced Datasets**: KNN may be biased towards the majority class in imbalanced datasets. Address this by using techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or changing the decision threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Choosing the Right K**: Selecting the optimal value of K can be challenging. Use techniques like cross-validation or grid search to find the best K for your specific dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Storage of Training Data**: KNN requires storing the entire training dataset in memory, which can be impractical for very large datasets. Consider using approximate nearest neighbor libraries or techniques like Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to reduce memory requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Categorical Data**: KNN naturally handles numerical data but may require preprocessing for categorical attributes. Use encoding techniques like one-hot encoding or distance metrics for categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Data Scaling**: KNN is sensitive to the scale of features, so feature scaling (e.g., normalization or standardization) is often necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Ineffective in Sparse Data**: KNN may not perform well on sparse datasets, where most feature values are zero. Other algorithms like Naive Bayes or decision trees may be more suitable.\n"
